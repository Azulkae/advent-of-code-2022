# Advent of Code 2022

Repo for my advent of code solutions

## Preparing for new day

1. Create a new folder, `Day X`
2. Copy the file under `Base/day.ts` into the new folder
3. Change the `currentDay` variable to `X`
4. Create a file `input.txt` in the new folder
5. Run the typescript build watch by doing `Ctrl + Shift + B` and selecting `tsc: watch`
6. Open a terminal by running `Ctrl + Shift + C`
7. Run `cd Day X` to navigate to the folder
8. Run `node day.js` (or whatever the file is named)

If this is all setup correctly you should get console logs for running both parts
